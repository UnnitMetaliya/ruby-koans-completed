  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why do we convert the list of symbols to strings and then compare
  # against the string value rather than against symbols?
  # Symbols are unique. For any symbol, only one of it exists.
  # So, if we compare two symbols, we are actually comparing object identity and not content of symbol.
  # with that being said, if you want to compare two symbols. We first need to convert them into string and then do the comparison.
  # For example, :true is a symbol. "true" is a string. But, if we do :true == "true", it will return false.

  # It's important to realize that symbols are not "immutable

  # Interesting. 
  # In my POV, this "feature" of Ruby can particularly be used as security purposes. 
  # Implementing confidential details as Symbols will make system like a beast.
  # For example, ad blockers block the FB ads by scrapping the word "Sponsored" from source code.
  # How about we make the string/word "Sponsored" as symbol.

  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why is it not a good idea to dynamically create a lot of symbols?
  # Because if we keep creating symbols, we know for the fact that they are immutable.
  # In future, we will not be able to change them when needed and it might be costly operation to convert them back to strings.
  # In simple term, once put into memory, they don't release the memory till "exit". This increases the time and space complexity.
  # Symbols should be used carefully and with extra attention to detail.
